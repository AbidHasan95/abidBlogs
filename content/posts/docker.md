```sudo usermod -aG docker $USER```

### Configure Docker to start on boot with systemd

Many modern Linux distributions use systemd to manage which services start when the system boots. On Debian and Ubuntu, the Docker service starts on boot by default. To automatically start Docker and containerd on boot for other Linux distributions using systemd, run the following commands and reboot:

```sh 
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd.service
```

To disable auto start on boot:
```sh
sudo systemctl disable docker.service

## Manipulation

Log in into the linux container, the image is based on
At first find the container ID through the following command
```
docker ps -a
```

Sample Output:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                     COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS                    PORTS                                              NAMES

```

For our use case, the container id is `aa410b4218cf`
Run the following command to log into the linux container with the container ID ```aa410b4218cf```
```
docker exec -u 0 -it aa410b4218cf /bin/bash
```
